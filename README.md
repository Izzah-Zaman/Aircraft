Aeroplane:

Javascript is used to move aircraft image up and down using arrow keys.
Background is moved relative to the image while the aircraft image is held stationary hence giving the effect 
of a moving aircraft. 
Background is moved using CSS animation.
If the obstacle touches the plane, it disappears. 
If an obstacles moves out of the window, a new obstacle appears.  
Collision of aircraft with obstacle is detected using bounding rectangle property and checking 
intersection of respective rectangles.
